# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server on port 9921
npm run build     # TypeScript compile + Vite production build
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
npm run preview   # Serve production build locally
```

No test suite is configured.

## Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** (strict mode)
- **styled-components 6** for all styling — no CSS modules or plain CSS
- **framer-motion** for animations
- **React Router DOM 7** for routing
- **Vite 6** as the build tool; SVGs are imported as React components via `vite-plugin-svgr`

## Architecture

The portfolio is structured as a **day-journey visualization** — five time-of-day sections (Dawn, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Midnight) that the user scrolls through, each representing a different facet of the developer's story.

### Key data flow

1. `Day.tsx` fetches `/data/portfolio.json` and transforms it into `TimeSection` objects via `transformJsonToTimeSections()` in `src/utils/`
2. Scroll position on `Day.tsx` drives `activeSection` + `scrollProgress` state, which gates animations and conditional rendering throughout the tree
3. Components consume `scrollProgress` as a 0–1 progress value passed as props

### Directory roles

- `src/components/DayJourney/TimeSection/` — one subdirectory per time period; each owns its own visuals and animations
- `src/components/DayJourney/TimeSection/Midnight/Constellation/` — animated constellation component featuring pets (Chinchilla, TabbyCat, Samoyed)
- `src/styles/theme.ts` — single source of truth for the warm amber/cream color palette, spacing scale, and responsive breakpoints (`sm` 640 / `md` 768 / `lg` 1024 / `xl` 1280)
- `src/styles/styled.d.ts` — TypeScript augmentation so the theme is fully typed in all styled-components
- `src/types/index.ts` — shared interfaces: `JsonSection`, `TimeSection`, `Constellation`

### Styling conventions

Use the `theme` object from styled-components (`${({ theme }) => theme.colors.primary}`) rather than hardcoded values. All responsive work is done with styled-components media queries referencing `theme.breakpoints`.
